# Music Composition 1

## Concept

**Uniformity** provides intelligible. **Variety** provides interesting

Notes are like letters. Motifs are like words. Notes create motif.

**Motif** is a combination of notes that form a short reoccurring musical idea (or "theme") which characterizes a piece
(or section) of music.
- Rhythmic motif
- Melodic motif
- Harmonic motif

Shorter is better. Motifs are generally anywhere from 2 to 8 notes.

Motifs are usually best when they contain at least 2 (or more) different note durations.

Where do composers get their musical ideas from? 
- Find a quiet place
- Try to hear the music in your head first (Inner hearing, recall sound in my without actually hearing the sound itself)
  - Imagine the sound of rain, imagine family member voice.
- Improvise on the piano
- Listen to a lot of well-written music
- Write down your ideas
  - Have no possibility of forgetting them
  - Be able to make changes and adjustments to your ideas without losing the originals forms.
  - Have multiple ideas to work with
  - The ideas you decide not to use can be saved and used in later compositions
