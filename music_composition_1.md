# Music Composition 1

## Rhythm

**Uniformity** provides intelligible. **Variety** provides interesting

**Notes** are like letters. **Motifs** are like words. **Phrases** are like sentences.

Notes create motif. Motifs create phrases.

**Motif** is a combination of notes that form a short reoccurring musical idea (or "theme") which characterizes a piece
(or section) of music.
- Rhythmic motif
- Melodic motif
- Harmonic motif

Good motif
- Shorter is better. Motifs are generally anywhere from 2 to 8 notes.
- Motifs are usually best when they contain at least 2 (or more) different note durations.

Where do composers get their musical ideas from? 
- Find a quiet place
- Try to hear the music in your head first (Inner hearing, recall sound in my without actually hearing the sound itself)
  - Imagine the sound of rain, imagine family member voice.
- Improvise on the piano
- Listen to a lot of well-written music
- Write down your ideas
  - Have no possibility of forgetting them
  - Be able to make changes and adjustments to your ideas without losing the originals forms.
  - Have multiple ideas to work with
  - The ideas you decide not to use can be saved and used in later compositions

**Musical phrase** stands alone as a complete thought or idea. A musical phrase is typically **4 measures in length**.

- Prepare at least 2 different motifs, 
- Repeat one of the motifs, which allows use to introduce the motif to the listener, and we can establish the primary motif
- Introduce another motif as secondary motif and repetition, so avoid being to uniform by only primary motif

3 types of phrases

- Suggest continuation
  - End with notes of short duration like **eighth note**
- Suggest a temporary repose
  - Place rests at the end of the phrase
  - End on a weak beat
- Suggest finality
  - End on a strong beat
  - End a note of longer duration than the notes that came before it like **whole note**

**Phrases** are like sentences. Sentences make paragraph. Phrases make **periods** and **phrase groups**.

A **period** consists of **2 phrases** that have relationship of **antecedent** and **consequent**. 

- Antecedent phrase
  - Ends weakly
  - Phrases that suggest **continuation** and **temporary repose** phrase
  - Question phrase
- Consequent phrase
  - Ends strongly
  - Phrases that suggest **finality** phrase
  - Answer phrase

**Phrase group** consists of 2 or more phrases that do not have antecedent to consequent relationship.

The example of phrase group is `question phrase -> question phrase -> answer phrase`

**Augmentation** is taking a motif or an entire phrase and increasing the duration of each note by the same proportion. 
For example, increase eighth note to quarter note, increase quarter note to half note. **Strict augmentation** is doubling 
the lengths. Increasing by 3 or 4 times is less common, because the increased motif will not be recognizable by listeners. 

**Diminution** is taking a motif or an entire phrase and decreasing the duration of each note by the same proportion. 
For example, a half note to a quarter note, a quarter note to an eighth note. **Strict diminution** is halving the lengths. 

**Augmentation** and **diminution** are techniques used to develop rhythmic material.

**Truncation** is when any part of the end of a motif or phrase is left off (truncated). It works best with phrases, 
because motif are already too short to truncate. Truncating by putting rests instead of notes for example.

**Expansion** is when any part of a motif or phrase is added on to the end of the original rhythm. Use a part of the 
original motif or phases to add.

**Displacement** (rhythmic displacement) is accomplished by shifting a motif or a phrase over so that it begins on a 
different beat. **Displacement changes the sound and feel of a motif or phrase because different notes will now be stronger.**

**Rhythmic mood** is the mood that can be created by being creative of using different types of rhythms. 
Different types of rhythms are duration, meter, tempo, dynamics, and articulations.

- **Notes of longer duration** usually depict the **less intense** emotions or moods.
  - Peacefulness
  - Tranquility
- **Notes of shorter duration** usually depict the **more intense** emotions or moods.
  - Franticness (Emotionally out of control)
  - Hurriedness
  - Loss of calmness 
- The same pattern repeated over and over again can depict **persistence** or **resoluteness**
  - To avoid too much uniformity, you can add rests between the same pattern.
- 4/4 meter can contribute to less intense moods.
- 2/4 meter can contribute to more intense moods.
- 3/4 meter can suggest a rocking or swinging back and forth to depict a **soothing or comforting mood**
  - Making it faster tempo, it can depict a **playful or joyous mood**.
- Fortissimo can depict angry
- Staccato articulations can create a lighthearted effect
- Markardo articulations can create a more agitated effect.

## Melody

**Melody** is an ordered succession of pitches. Melody cannot be separated from rhythm, but rhythm can be separated from melody,
because pitch has duration and duration gives us rhythm. Rhythm contributes to the identity of a melody.

Melody must move, meaning changing pitches. Melody can move in the following ways

- Direction of movement
  - Ascending
  - Descending
  - A good piece should have both ascending and descending. If it only has one direction, it sounds dull and uninteresting.
- Size of movement (Intervallic distance)
  - Conjunct
    - Movement by 2nds. Stepwise motion. movement with 1 step is also conjunct.
    - For example, D -> E (stepping up). D -> C (stepping down).
    - More natural movement than disjunct, more connected to scale into the human voice.
  - Disjunct
    - Movement by any interval larger than a 2nd. Skipwise motion 
    - For example, E -> G (skipping up, interval by 3rd). E -> C (skipping down, interval by 4th)

The most melodic melodies contain **a balance of ascending, descending, stepwise and skipwise motion**. These types of 
melodies are very **singable, memorable, and stick with us**.

Melody has a close connection to speech in terms of the range of pitch. The pitch in our voice varies only slightly when 
we speak and doesn't jump from one extreme to another. This is why melodies usually stay within the range of an 8th or an 8th and a 3rd.

The most basic melodies arise from groups of pitches called **keys** and from the possibilities within the pitches of the scale.

**Transcribe** is hearing a rhythm, melody, or harmony and being able to notate it.

- It might be easier to notate the rhythm first on a single pitch and then go back over it and change the pitches to those of the melody.
- Always start by determining the meter. To determine the meter listen for the strong pulses.
- Once you have determined the meter try writing down the first measure.
- Once you think you have the first measure down move on to the next measure.
- Continue one measure at a time until you have the entire melody notated.

**Melodic motif** involves the pitches of the notes. 
- Most melodic motifs will coincide with the rhythmic motifs. 
- Melodic motif can appear with changed rhythm.
  - You may change the rhythmic structure of a melody while maintaining its melodic motif
- Interval quality can be different, but interval number must be the same
  - e.g. Motif with Major 3rd -> restated motif with Minor 3rd
  - But not motif with 3rd -> restated motif with 4th

Techniques used for developing melodic motifs and for adding melodic material
- **Repetition**
  - **String repetition** repeats the original motif for note to note, all the pitches, all the durations are identical.
- **Transposition**
  - The motif is repeated but at a higher or lower pitch
  - Each pitch is shifted up or down (transposed)
  - Relative distance between pitches remains the same.
  - **Diatonic transposition** is when the motif is transposed but continues to use pitches found in the key of the piece.
  - **Chromatic transposition** is when the motif is transposed but uses pitches not found in the key of the piece.
- Sequence
  - **Sequences** are very easy way of creating melodies out of motifs.
  - Combination of repetition and transposition 
  - The repetition of a motif 3 or more times, with each repetition being transposed by the same interval higher in pitch 
    (or by the same interval lower in pitch)
  - Sequence can be either ascending or descending but **cannot be both in the same sequence**.
  - Sequence do not necessarily need to move higher or lower **by seconds**, but it's common.

**Diatonic** refers to the major and minor scales.

**Diatonic sequence** means that each time the motif is restated, it remains in the same key. It only uses pitches from a particular key or scale. 
This causes slight differences in the proportional distance between pitches.

**Chromatic sequence** means that, in order to keep the distance between pitches exactly the same from one statement of the motif 
to the next, we need to **sharp** or **flat** certain notes in the subsequent measures. This makes us use the pitches that 
are not found on the key. 

**Intervallic expansion** is the repetition of the melodic motif using larger intervals. When using intervallic expansion, 
the intervals can be made larger by any amount. For example, 3rd -> 4th. 3rd -> 5th, 6th, or 7th.

- A single interval may be expanded
- Multiple intervals may be expanded
- All intervals may be expanded

**Intervallic compression** is the opposite of intervallic expansion.

- A single interval may be compressed
- Multiple intervals may be compressed
- All intervals may be compressed

**Octave transfer** is similar to transposition. **After octave transfer, if the motif is still clearly recognizable, then 
we have done a good job of balancing the principles of uniformity and variety**.

- A single pitch may be transposed by an octave
- Several pitches may be transposed by an octave
- Entire motif may be transposed by an octave

**Change of tonality** is changing major to minor, or minor to major

**Melodic phrase** is the musical equivalent of the sentence. It can stand alone as a complete thought or idea.

- Typically 2-4 measures in length
- Most are divisible by 2
- Most melodic phrases are made up of a number of different motifs
  - Primary motif + secondary motif
  - Too many motifs means lack of unity and unintelligible
  - Too few motifs means lack of variety and dull

**Transposition + multiple motifs** can create unity and variety

Primary motif + transposed primary motif + secondary motif + transposed secondary motif

**Stable tones** are the pitches that form the tonic chord.

In C major, stable tones are 1 (C, **tonic**), 3 (E, **mediant**), and 5 (G, **dominant**)

**Tonic** is the most stable. **Dominant** is the second most stable. **Mediant** is the third most stable. 
All other tones are **unstable tones**.

**Stable tones can suggest temporary repose or suggest finality**. Usually **median and dominant suggests temporary repose**.
**Tonic** suggests finality.

**Unstable tone can suggest continuation**. Since it's not stable, our ear feels that we are not at rest yet and expect 
the music to continue.

**Inversion** is the restatement of the motif (or phrase) with all its intervals moving in the opposite direction. For 
example, if the motif is moving a 3rd higher in pitch, then inversion is motif moving a 3rd lower in pitch. Everything 
is upside down.

**Transposed inversion** is to change the pitch of the starting note of a normal inversion, while a normal inversion 
starts with the same pitch.

**Mirror inversion** is to add flat or sharp to maintain the quality of each interval same as original.

**Retrograde** is to restate the motif or phrase in reverse (original played backwards), while inversion restate it upside down.

**Retrograde inversion** is to restate motif or phrase upside down and backwards. Steps are 1. Flip the original upside down.
2. Play it backwards.

**Chord tones** are the pitches of a chord (e.g. C Major, C Minor) that have been used to make up a melodic motif or phrase.

**Non-chord tones** are the pitches of a melodic motif or phrase that do not belong to the chord that makes up that melodic motif or phrase.

Melodies may be made up of chord tones and non-chord tones.

To distinguish chord tones and non-chord tones, find the frequently appearing tones or pitches which appear on beat positions for chord-tones. 
Distinguish the feeling from the entire motif or phrase, for example, whether is major or minor.

**Passing tones** are a type of non-chord tones, used to pass between chord tones.
- A passing tone must be **between** two chord tones.
- A passing tone must move in **stepwise** motion.
- A passing tone must move in a **continuous** direction away from and to the next chord tone.

There is **double passing tone** where there are two non-chord tones between chord tones instead of one non-chord tone.

When passing tones are at strong beats, it's **accented passing tone**.

**Neighbor tone** is also a type of non-chord tones.
- A neighbor tone must be **between** two chord tones.
- A neighbor tone must move in **stepwise** motion.
- A neighbor tone must move in a **discontinuous** motion away from and immediately return to the same chord tone.

The only difference between a passing tone and a neighbor tone is whether the motion is continuous or discontinuous.

If a neighbor tone is place at strong beats, it's **accented neighbor tone**.

**Chromatic tones** are the pitches not found in the scale, while **diatonic** refers to the pitches iin the scale. 
Chromatic tones can be chromatic passing tones or chromatic neighbor tones. Both may be accented or non-accented.

**Incomplete neighbor tone** is a type of non-chord tone which occurs between two chord tones, but is neighbor to only one. 
**Escape tone** is a type of incomplete neighbor tone which happens by stepwise motion from a chord tone and go back to 
a chord tone by skipwise motion in non-accented position. **Appoggiature** is also a type of incomplete neighbor tone which appears by skipwise 
motion from a chord tone and go back to a chord tone by stepwise motion in accented position.

**Anticipation tone** is a tone that anticipates the next chord tone. This tone is a non-chord tone in the current measure, 
but it will become a chord tone in the next measure. A chord tone in the next measure is being played early in anticipation of 
the changing chord. Anticipation tones are **non-accented**.

**Suspension tone** is a pitch that is **held over through the next chord change**. 
It is a chord tone as it relates to the chord preceding it abd a non-chord tone as it relates to the chord that immediately follows.
A suspension tone is **accented**. Suspensions must resolve downwards by a step to the next tone. 
If a suspension tone resolves upwards by a step to the next tone, it's called **retardation tone**.

Suspension and retardation tones may also be **tied** instead of played again.
