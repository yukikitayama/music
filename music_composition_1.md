# Music Composition 1

## Concept

**Uniformity** provides intelligible. **Variety** provides interesting

**Notes** are like letters. **Motifs** are like words. **Phrases** are like sentences.

Notes create motif. Motifs create phrases.

**Motif** is a combination of notes that form a short reoccurring musical idea (or "theme") which characterizes a piece
(or section) of music.
- Rhythmic motif
- Melodic motif
- Harmonic motif

Shorter is better. Motifs are generally anywhere from 2 to 8 notes.

Motifs are usually best when they contain at least 2 (or more) different note durations.

Where do composers get their musical ideas from? 
- Find a quiet place
- Try to hear the music in your head first (Inner hearing, recall sound in my without actually hearing the sound itself)
  - Imagine the sound of rain, imagine family member voice.
- Improvise on the piano
- Listen to a lot of well-written music
- Write down your ideas
  - Have no possibility of forgetting them
  - Be able to make changes and adjustments to your ideas without losing the originals forms.
  - Have multiple ideas to work with
  - The ideas you decide not to use can be saved and used in later compositions

**Musical phrase** stands alone as a complete thought or idea. A musical phrase is typically **4 measures in length**.

- Prepare at least 2 different motifs, 
- Repeat one of the motifs, which allows use to introduce the motif to the listener, and we can establish the primary motif
- Introduce another motif as secondary motif and repetition, so avoid being to uniform by only primary motif

3 types of phrases

- Suggest continuation
  - End with notes of short duration like **eighth note**
- Suggest a temporary repose
  - Place rests at the end of the phrase
  - End on a weak beat
- Suggest finality
  - End on a strong beat
  - End a note of longer duration than the notes that came before it like **whole note**

**Phrases** are like sentences. Sentences make paragraph. Phrases make **periods** and **phrase groups**.

A **period** consists of **2 phrases** that have relationship of **antecedent** and **consequent**. 

- Antecedent phrase
  - Ends weakly
  - Use **continuation** and **temporary repose** phrase
- Consequent phrase
  - Ends strongly
  - Use **finality** phrase

**Phrase group** consists of 2 or more phrases that do not have antecedent to consequent relationship. 

**Augmentation** is taking a motif or an entire phrase and increasing the duration of each note by the same proportion. 
For example, increase eighth note to quarter note, increase quarter note to half note. **Strict augmentation** is doubling 
the lengths. Increasing by 3 or 4 times is less common, because the increased motif will not be recognizable by listeners. 

**Diminution** is taking a motif or an entire phrase and decreasing the duration of each note by the same proportion. 
For example, a half note to a quarter note, a quarter note to an eighth note. **Strict diminution** is halving the lengths. 

**Augmentation** and **diminution** are techniques used to develop rhythmic material.

**Truncation** is when any part of the end of a motif or phrase is left off (truncated). It works best with phrases, 
because motif are already too short to truncate. Truncating by putting rests instead of notes for example.

**Expansion** is when any part of a motif or phrase is added on to the end of the original rhythm.

**Displacement** (rhythmic displacement) is accomplished by shifting a motif or a phrase over so that it begins on a 
different beat. **Displacement changes the sound and feel of a motif or phrase because different notes will now be stronger.**

**Rhythmic mood** is the mood that can be created by being creative of using different types of rhythms. 
Different types of rhythms are duration, meter, tempo, dynamics, and articulations.

- **Notes of longer duration** usually depict the **less intense** emotions or moods.
  - Peacefulness
  - Tranquility
- **Notes of shorter duration** usually depict the **more intense** emotions or moods.
  - Franticness (Emotionally out of control)
  - Hurriedness
  - Loss of calmness 
- The same pattern repeated over and over again can depict **persistence** or **resoluteness**
  - To avoid too much uniformity, you can add rests between the same pattern.
- 4/4 meter can contribute to less intense moods.
- 2/4 meter can contribute to more intense moods.
- 3/4 meter can suggest a rocking or swinging back and forth to depict a **soothing or comforting mood**
  - Making it faster tempo, it can depict a **playful or joyous mood**.
- Fortissimo can depict angry
- Staccato articulations can create a lighthearted effect
- Markardo articulations can create a more agitated effect.
