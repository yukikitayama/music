Delvon Lamarr Organ Trio
You need to have focus to listen to their music because there are lots of interactions between instruments.
Something that you expect when you go to a jazz.
Lots of improvisation.
This is the unit that I started to like organ as musical instrument.
Delvon Lamarr is very good at talking. He made many jokes during the performance.
Their songs somehow makes me happy. Maybe the sound of organ is warm, and their score are cheerful.

John Brothers Piano Company
It minded me of the Spotify playlist Electro Swing.
Many of their music makes you feel you wanna dance. But not today's dance. Some kind of a dance one generation before.
Trumpet was cool
A guy of trumpet and another guy of drums also played piano.
And the original piano guy played clarinet too.
Members were changing their roles, which was new to me during a jazz, and it was interesting to watch.
