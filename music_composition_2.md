# Music Composition 2

Music written in a key is build upon the notes of the scale. The notes of the scales are the pitches that composers 
can choose to form a melody.

7 distinct chords can be formed using only the pitches of the scale. 7 chords are the most likely used to harmonize melody.

It's possible for a chord to use pitches outside of the key, but for simplicity, focus only on dealing with **diatonic chords**
(chords that use only the pitches of the diatonic scale)

I chord, IV chord, V chord are called **primary chords**. The primary chords can **harmonize any melody made up from the pitches of the scale**.

When a piece is written in a **minor key**, the primary chords have the same tonal functions as the primary chords in major keys.

**Chord progression** is a succession of chords moving toward a definite tonal goal.

**Basic chord progression structure** is **departure, anticipation, and return**. To achieve this structure, at least
3 different chords are needed. 

**Departure** is moving away from the tonic

**Anticipation** is the aural (pertaining to hearing) expectation of hearing the tonic again

**Return** is coming back home to the tonic chord.

In `I -> IV -> V -> I`, IV is departure from tonic, V is anticipation to return of tonic, and the last I is return to tonic.

This is not to say that every chord progression must follow 1, 4, 5, 1 but it will serve as a great foundation.

**Tonal function** is the role each chord plays in a chord progression. A chord's tonal function is determined by the 
degree of the scale the chord is built upon.

3 tonal functions
- Tonic function
  - To establish the key
  - I chord
- Pre-dominant function (sub-dominant function)
  - To lead away from the tonic to the dominant
  - IV chord
- Dominant function
  - To lead back to the tonic
  - V chord

**Voices** are the individual pitches of a chord.

**Voice leading** is the manner in which each voice in one chord transitions to the corresponding voice in the subsequent chord. 
Movement from one chord to another chord is at its foundation melodic in nature. In a chord, **top voice** is the pitch 
at the top of a chord, **middle voice** is in the middle, and  **bottom voice** is the pitch at the bottom of a chord.

The transition between chords is most pleasant when one (or more) of the voices remains on the same pitch, 
and one (or more) of the other voices moves by a whole step or helf step.

- Continuity
  - By keeping one voice the same in each chord we create continuity between the 2 chords
- More melodic
  - Movement by steps is the most melodic form of movement.
  - It's natural to the human voice and the movement we find present in the scale.
