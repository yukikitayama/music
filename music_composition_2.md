# Music Composition 2

Music written in a key is build upon the notes of the scale. The notes of the scales are the pitches that composers 
can choose to form a melody.

7 distinct chords can be formed using only the pitches of the scale. 7 chords are the most likely used to harmonize melody.

It's possible for a chord to use pitches outside of the key, but for simplicity, focus only on dealing with **diatonic chords**
(chords that use only the pitches of the diatonic scale)

I chord, IV chord, V chord are called **primary chords**. The primary chords can **harmonize any melody made up from the pitches of the scale**.

When a piece is written in a **minor key**, the primary chords have the same tonal functions as the primary chords in major keys.

**Chord progression** is a succession of chords moving toward a definite tonal goal.

**Basic chord progression structure** is **departure, anticipation, and return**. To achieve this structure, at least
3 different chords are needed. 

**Departure** is moving away from the tonic

**Anticipation** is the aural (pertaining to hearing) expectation of hearing the tonic again

**Return** is coming back home to the tonic chord.

In `I -> IV -> V -> I`, IV is departure from tonic, V is anticipation to return of tonic, and the last I is return to tonic.

This is not to say that every chord progression must follow 1, 4, 5, 1 but it will serve as a great foundation.

**Tonal function** is the role each chord plays in a chord progression. A chord's tonal function is determined by the 
degree of the scale the chord is built upon.

3 tonal functions
- Tonic function
  - To establish the key
  - I chord
- Pre-dominant function (sub-dominant function)
  - To lead away from the tonic to the dominant
  - IV chord
- Dominant function
  - To lead back to the tonic
  - V chord

**Voices** are the individual pitches of a chord.

**Voice leading** is the manner in which each voice in one chord transitions to the corresponding voice in the subsequent chord. 
Movement from one chord to another chord is at its foundation melodic in nature. In a chord, **top voice** is the pitch 
at the top of a chord, **middle voice** is in the middle, and  **bottom voice** is the pitch at the bottom of a chord.

The transition between chords is most pleasant when one (or more) of the voices remains on the same pitch, 
and one (or more) of the other voices moves by a whole step or helf step.

- Continuity
  - By keeping one voice the same in each chord we create continuity between the 2 chords
- More melodic
  - Movement by steps is the most melodic form of movement.
  - It's natural to the human voice and the movement we find present in the scale.

**Secondary chord** are the other chords (than I, IV, V) that can be built from the pitches of the scale.
Each primary chord has a secondary chord counterpart that **shares two pitches in common**.
The secondary chords are interchangeable with their primary counterparts. When a secondary chord is substituted for a 
primary chord, it can take on that primary chord function.
- Minor chords
  - VI: Tonic substitution
    - I
    - (IV. VI chord can have pre-dominant function too)
  - II: Pre-dominant substitution
    - IV
  - III: Dominant substitution
    - V
    - (I. III chord can have tonic function too)
- Diminished major chord
  - VII: Dominant substitution
    - V

Chords with two pitches in common can be easily substituted for one another and still retain the same function.

"Departure, anticipation and return"

`T - PD - D - T`

Not every single piece of music ever written fits neatly into this pattern, but many do. It's a helpful guide and a useful starting point.

`T` = Tonic. `PD` = Pre-dominant. `D` = Dominant.

`Ts` = Tonic substitute. `PDs` = Pre-dominant substitute. `Ds` = Dominant substitute.

Choose a chord from each circle in clockwise

Elements that make some chord changes more appealing than others
- Voice leading
- Amount of similarity between two chords
  - Triads can have **two** pitches in common
    - **Subtle** chord change
  - Triads can have **one** pitches in common
    - **Strong** chord change
  - Triads can have **zero** pitches in common
    - **Stark** chord change

The 3 S's in chord progression
- Subtle
- Strong
- Stark

Composers can develop the basic chord progression formula by extending functions, chaining progression.

**Function extension** by using function substitutes, extend any 3 of the functions; T, PD, D. For example, `T - PDs - PD - D - T`

**Chain progressions** is to overlap the end of one and the start of another. e.g. `T - PD - Ds - T - PDs - D - T`

**Partial progression formula** is `I -> IV -> I` or `I -> V -> I`. We can leave out either pre-dominant or dominant.

**Circle progression** is based on the circle of 5ths. For example, descending **perfect fifth** followed by ascending **perfect fourth**. 
Ascending perfect fourth is equivalent to an inverted perfect fifth.

**Harmonic phrase** is a succession of chords ending in a cadence. 
Harmonic phrase is typically 2-4 measures in length and is tied to the rhythmic and melodic phrase.

**Cadence** is a progression of two chords that expresses some degree of finality. It's like musical punctuation. 
There are 4 types of cadences. Each of the cadences has a different strength and helps to determine the types of phrases within a piece of music.

4 types of cadences
- Authentic cadence (Strongest type of cadence, suggest **Finality**)
  - V to I
  - V7 to I
- Plagal cadence (**Finality**, strong)
  - IV to I
- Half cadence (**Continuation**, weak)
  - I to V
  - ii to V
  - vi to V
  - IV to V
- Deceptive cadence (**Temporary repose**, weak)
  - V to a chord other than I
  - Most often it's V to vi (Weak cadence which can suggest temporary repose)
    - Ears expect to hear I after V, but hear vi instead, and vi is substitute of tonic I.

Along with cadences, another factor that helps determine what a musical phrase suggests is the final chord's tonal function
- A musical phrase that ends on any chord with a **pre-dominant** or **dominant** function suggests **continuation**.
  - Also suggested by ending in a **half cadence**
- A musical phrase that ends on a **tonic substitute** suggests **temporary repose**.
  - Also suggested by ending in a **deceptive cadence of V to vi**.
- A musical phrase that ends on **"I" always suggests finality**.
  - Finality can be suggested by **Plagal cadence** or **authentic cadence**.

**Harmonic period** is two phrases that have an antecendent to consequent relationship by combining phrases. 
Call these phrases **question and answer** phrases. 
Antecendent phrase (question phrase) is the weaker phrase which is followed by the consequent phrase (answer phrase) is the stronger phrase.
**Strength of the phrase is determined by the cadence that ends the phrase**.
Antecedent to consequent relationship is said to exist as long as the second phrase is the stronger phrase.

`period = phrase 1 + phrase 2 = half cadence + perfect authentic cadence`

**Phrase group (Three-phrase period)** is when three phrases are combined. 
- Two questions (antecedents) and one answer (consequent). This is more common. 
- One question (antecedent) and two answers (consequents).

**Double period** contains four phrases.
- Phrase 1 & 2
  - Antecedent
  - Ends with Half Cadence
  - End of phrase 1 is weak
- Phrase 3 & 4
  - Consequent
  - ENds with Perfect Authentic Cadence
  - End of phrase 3 is weak

**Diatonic chord** is a chord made up of pitches within the key

**Chromatic chord** is a chord that includes one or more pitches from outside the key.

**Borrowed chords** are chords taken from the parallel key. **Parallel keys** are keys that share the same root. 
For example, F major and F minor are parallel keys, because they share the same root of F.
Borrowed chords that share the same Roman numeral name are able to share the same function, meaning can substitute one for another. 
As a result, one or two notes will be in common.
For example, C minor i can substitute C major I.
**Because chords from the parallel key that share the same Roman numeral share the same roots and/or because they have one or two notes in common**, they can be easily substituted for one another.

**It's more common for a song in a major key to borrow chords from a minor key than a song in a minor key to borrow chords from a major key**.

**Altered chord** is a cord that has one or more of its pitches replaced with a chromatic pitch not normally found in the key. 
An altered chords differs from a borrowed chord in that it does not belong to the parallel key. 
The most common type of altered chord is the **secondary dominan**t.

**Secondary dominant** is a chord outside of the current key (non-diatonic) which can act as a **dominant** to one of the chords within the current key (diatonic). 
Secondary dominants **tonicize** the chord of which they are the dominant. 
**Tonicization** us taking a chord that is not the tonic chord and making it temporarily sound as if it were a brand new tonic chord.
A secondary dominant chord will always be followed by the chord of which it is the **dominant**.

In other words, from the any chord in the current key, find secondary dominant as altered chord by the perfect 5th higher from the beginning chord, 
and the secondary dominant will work as dominant, and the beginning any chord will sound like tonic, even if they are not tonic.

When composers use secondary dominant chords in their compositions, they are taking a chord from another key and bringing it into the current key where it does not normally belong.

"V/V", "V of V", "Five of five", "Dominant of the dominant"

Tips for using secondary dominants in chord progression
- A secondary dominant will typically be preceded by a chord that has one or two notes in common with it.
- A secondary dominant chord will always be followed by the chord of which it is the dominant.

"V/IV" is identical to the tonic chord fo the key. "V/IV" is not used as a secondary dominant. Instead, **"V7/IV"** is used to make clear the secondary dominant function.

**Picardy third** is when the expected minor tonic chord is changed to a major tonic chord.

**Modulation** is changing from one key to a different key within a single movement of a piece.
Key change between movements in a larger piece with multiple movements is not modulation but rather "change of key".
Modulation satisfies the compositional principle of **variety** and brings the change necessary to keep a piece from becoming repetitive and boring.
Modulation involves the **establishment of a new tonic chord**. 
When a new chord is used as the tonic chord for a very short period of time, it's considered **tonicization** rather than modulation.

Using **pivot chords (common-chords)** is one of the most common ways to modulate.
Pivot chords are chords that are common to the key you are starting in and the key you are modulating to.

**Pivot tone** is a tone that is common to both the key you are starting in and the key you are modulating to.
e.g. D minor and F major are common in both the key of C major and the key of B flat major. Those D minor and F major are called **common chord** and work as **pivot chord** between C major key and B flat major key.

**Keys further apart on the circle of 5ths have fewer chords in common.
A part of circle of 5ths around C major is `B_flat - F - C - G - D`.
C major has 4 chords in common with F major and G major. But C major has only 2 chords in common with B flat and D major.
Once you go beyond two 5ths on the circle in either direction, there are no shared chords from the center key.

3 steps to modulation using pivot chords
1. A tonic must already be firmly established
2. A pivot chord is used and the tonal center begins to change
3. A new tonic is firmly established and made clear to the listener.
    1. Typically a new tonic is established by means of a cadence.

**Related keys** are keys that are closer to each other on the **circle of 5ths**.

**Pivot tone modulation (common-tone modulation)** uses a **single tone** that is common to both the starting key and the destination key in order to modulate.

**Sequential modulation** is modulation through a **chromatic sequence**.

**Direct modulation (abrupt modulation)** is modulation that is abrupt. It doesn't use pivot chords, pivot tones, altered chords or sequences to help smooth out the modulation. Direct modulation is also referred to as **phrase modulation** because this type of modulation typically occurs between two phrases. Also appear between sections.

**Triplet** is 3 of one type of note played in the same amount of time as 2 of the same type of note. The most common way to indicate triplets is with a single number 3 placed over or under the notes with or without a bracket or curved line. The triplet can be written as a rator like `3:2`.

**Tuplet** is an artificial division of the meat, multiples of the beatm or subdivisions of the beat, that does not exist within the meter. Some types of tuplets include duplets, triplets, quintuplets, sextuplets, septuplets, and nonuplets. The most common type of tuplet is the triplet.

**Duplet** is in sense the opposite of a triplet. 2 of one type of note are played **in the same amount of time that is would normally take to play 3 of the same type of note**.

Both triplets and duplets are artificial divisions of the beat, multiples of the beat, or subdivisions of the beat, that do not exist within the meter. Triplets appear in **simple meters where the pulse is normally divisible by 2**. Duplets appear in **compound meters where the pulse is normally divisible by 3**.
