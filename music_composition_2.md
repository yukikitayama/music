# Music Composition 2

Music written in a key is build upon the notes of the scale. The notes of the scales are the pitches that composers 
can choose to form a melody.

7 distinct chords can be formed using only the pitches of the scale. 7 chords are the most likely used to harmonize melody.

It's possible for a chord to use pitches outside of the key, but for simplicity, focus only on dealing with **diatonic chords**
(chords that use only the pitches of the diatonic scale)

I chord, IV chord, V chord are called **primary chords**. The primary chords can **harmonize any melody made up from the pitches of the scale**.

When a piece is written in a **minor key**, the primary chords have the same tonal functions as the primary chords in major keys.

**Chord progression** is a succession of chords moving toward a definite tonal goal.

**Basic chord progression structure** is **departure, anticipation, and return**. To achieve this structure, at least
3 different chords are needed. 

**Departure** is moving away from the tonic

**Anticipation** is the aural (pertaining to hearing) expectation of hearing the tonic again

**Return** is coming back home to the tonic chord.

In `I -> IV -> V -> I`, IV is departure from tonic, V is anticipation to return of tonic, and the last I is return to tonic.

This is not to say that every chord progression must follow 1, 4, 5, 1 but it will serve as a great foundation.

**Tonal function** is the role each chord plays in a chord progression. A chord's tonal function is determined by the 
degree of the scale the chord is built upon.

3 tonal functions
- Tonic function
  - To establish the key
  - I chord
- Pre-dominant function (sub-dominant function)
  - To lead away from the tonic to the dominant
  - IV chord
- Dominant function
  - To lead back to the tonic
  - V chord

**Voices** are the individual pitches of a chord.

**Voice leading** is the manner in which each voice in one chord transitions to the corresponding voice in the subsequent chord. 
Movement from one chord to another chord is at its foundation melodic in nature. In a chord, **top voice** is the pitch 
at the top of a chord, **middle voice** is in the middle, and  **bottom voice** is the pitch at the bottom of a chord.

The transition between chords is most pleasant when one (or more) of the voices remains on the same pitch, 
and one (or more) of the other voices moves by a whole step or helf step.

- Continuity
  - By keeping one voice the same in each chord we create continuity between the 2 chords
- More melodic
  - Movement by steps is the most melodic form of movement.
  - It's natural to the human voice and the movement we find present in the scale.

**Secondary chord** are the other chords (than I, IV, V) that can be built from the pitches of the scale.
Each primary chord has a secondary chord counterpart that **shares two pitches in common**.
The secondary chords are interchangeable with their primary counterparts. When a secondary chord is substituted for a 
primary chord, it can take on that primary chord function.
- Minor chords
  - VI: Tonic substitution
    - I
    - (IV. VI chord can have pre-dominant function too)
  - II: Pre-dominant substitution
    - IV
  - III: Dominant substitution
    - V
    - (I. III chord can have tonic function too)
- Diminished major chord
  - VII: Dominant substitution
    - V

Chords with two pitches in common can be easily substituted for one another and still retain the same function.

"Departure, anticipation and return"

`T - PD - D - T`

Not every single piece of music ever written fits neatly into this pattern, but many do. It's a helpful guide and a useful starting point.

`T` = Tonic. `PD` = Pre-dominant. `D` = Dominant.

`Ts` = Tonic substitute. `PDs` = Pre-dominant substitute. `Ds` = Dominant substitute.

Choose a chord from each circle in clockwise

Elements that make some chord changes more appealing than others
- Voice leading
- Amount of similarity between two chords
  - Triads can have **two** pitches in common
    - **Subtle** chord change
  - Triads can have **one** pitches in common
    - **Strong** chord change
  - Triads can have **zero** pitches in common
    - **Stark** chord change

The 3 S's in chord progression
- Subtle
- Strong
- Stark

Composers can develop the basic chord progression formula by extending functions, chaining progression.

**Function extension** by using function substitutes, extend any 3 of the functions; T, PD, D. For example, `T - PDs - PD - D - T`

**Chain progressions** is to overlap the end of one and the start of another. e.g. `T - PD - Ds - T - PDs - D - T`

**Partial progression formula** is `I -> IV -> I` or `I -> V -> I`. We can leave out either pre-dominant or dominant.

**Circle progression** is based on the circle of 5ths. For example, descending **perfect fifth** followed by ascending **perfect fourth**. 
Ascending perfect fourth is equivalent to an inverted perfect fifth.

**Harmonic phrase** is a succession of chords ending in a cadence. 
Harmonic phrase is typically 2-4 measures in length and is tied to the rhythmic and melodic phrase.

**Cadence** is a progression of two chords that expresses some degree of finality. It's like musical punctuation. 
There are 4 types of cadences. Each of the cadences has a different strength and helps to determine the types of phrases within a piece of music.

4 types of cadences
- Authentic cadence (Strongest type of cadence, suggest **Finality**)
  - V to I
  - V7 to I
- Plagal cadence (**Finality**, strong)
  - IV to I
- Half cadence (**Continuation**, weak)
  - I to V
  - ii to V
  - vi to V
  - IV to V
- Deceptive cadence (**Temporary repose**, weak)
  - V to a chord other than I
  - Most often it's V to vi (Weak cadence which can suggest temporary repose)
    - Ears expect to hear I after V, but hear vi instead, and vi is substitute of tonic I.

Along with cadences, another factor that helps determine what a musical phrase suggests is the final chord's tonal function
- A musical phrase that ends on any chord with a **pre-dominant** or **dominant** function suggests **continuation**.
  - Also suggested by ending in a **half cadence**
- A musical phrase that ends on a **tonic substitute** suggests **temporary repose**.
  - Also suggested by ending in a **deceptive cadence of V to vi**.
- A musical phrase that ends on **"I" always suggests finality**.
  - Finality can be suggested by **Plagal cadence** or **authentic cadence**.
