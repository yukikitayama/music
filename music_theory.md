# Music Theory

Music is made up of **rhythm** and **pitch**.
- Rhythm is relative duration of sound (shorter vs. longer)
  - **Rhythm is more fundamental than pitch**.
  - Rhythm can exist without pitch
  - Rhythm comes naturally to more people than pitch.
- Pitch is relative frequency of sound (lower vs. higher)
  - Pitch cannot exist without rhythm
  - Pitch can be classified as **melody** or **harmony**.

**Melody** is an ordered sequence of pitches

**Harmony** is two or more pitches heard simultaneously.

**Note parts**
- Note head
- Stem
- Flag

**Note duration**
- Whole note
- Half note
- Quarter note
- Eighth note
- Sixteenth note

When notes with flags are grouped together, the flags are replaced by **beams**.

**Beat** is a unit of measurement. **Rhythm** is the relative duration of sound. Beat is often used interchangeably with rhythm but they are not the same thing. We can defignate any note as the unit of measurement by assigning to it a value of 1. 
**1 beat is not 1 second**.

**Quarter note** has been designated as the beat or unit of measurement. We assign to it a value of 1.

**Multiples of the unit** are whole note and half notes. **Subdivisions of the unit** are eighth notes and sixteenth notes.

**Tempo** is the actual time of a note. The rate at which the beats occur in actual time. Tempo is an Italian of rate of speed.

**Tempo marking**
- Allegro
  - Fast
  - 120 - 139 bpm
- Moderato
  - Moderate, medium
  - 101 - 110 bpm
- Adagio
  - Slow
  - 66 - 76 bpm

**Metronome marking** tells us typically by quarter note equal to a number, meaning how many beats it creates per **minute** (bpm). e.g. `Quarter note = 120` means 120 beats per minute. A quarter note occurs at a rate of 2 per second.

**Meter** is the natural division of rhythms into equal sized groups. **Measure** is the distance from one bar line to the next, a space between 2 bar lines, which measures a time through beats. "In 3" means 3 beats in one measure.

**Bar line** is the vertical line that divides the music into equal groups of beats.

**Time signature** is a meter indicated at the start of a song by 2 numbers. Top number indicates **number of beats per measure**. Bottom number indicates **unit of measurement**. Bottom number 4 means quarter note is designated as unit of measurement, meaning assigned a value of 1.

`C` means common time 4/4.

**Rests** are relative durations of silence

When a **dot** is placed to the **right of the note head**, the duration of the note is **increased by one half of the note's value**. Non-dotted notes are divisible by 2. Dotted notes are divisible by 3. The use of the dot developed around the mid-13th century.

**Tie** is a curved line strung between two notes, indicating that the durations are to be added together. Notes can be tied across bar lines. Any note durations may be tied together.

The same rhythm can be written using ties or dotted notes. Tie is easy to see beats but more cluttered. Dot is harder to see beats but less cluttered. Dot is more common expression.

**3/8 and 6/8 meters** are read "three eight meter" and "six eight meter". 
The 8 in 3/8 meter and 6/8 meter indicates that the **eighth note** has been designated as the unit of measurement and assigned a value of 1. 
The 3 in 3/8 meter indicates that there are 3 beats in each measure, and 6 in 6/8 meter indicates there are 6 beats in each measure. 
The pulse strength of the beats in 3/8 meter is `strong - weak - weak`. 
The pulse strength of the beats in 6/8 meter is `very strong - weak - weak - less strong - weak - weak`. 
**The note values in 3/8 are double those in 3/4**.

**Cut time (2/2 meter, "two two meter")** is the meter in which there are 2 beats per measure and the half note is equal to 1 beat. 
Cut time is notated either as the letter "C" with a vertical line through it or as 2 over 2. 
The top number in 2/2 meter indicates that there are two beats per measure.
The bottom number in 2/2 meter indicates that the half note has been designated as the beat and assigned a value of 1.
The strong beat in cut time occurs on beat 1 of each measure.
Cut time is useful for reading music that is meant to be played at **fast tempos**.
2/2 meter sometimes appears for the readability of notes in scores.

**Simple meter** is any meter in which the pulse can be divided by two. In simple meter, **pulse** refers to the beat.
- **Duple meter** is any meter in which there are 2 pulses per measure.
- **Triple meter** is any meter in which there are 3 pulses per measure.
- **Quadruple meter** is any meter in which there are 4 pulses per measure.

**Compound meter** is any meter in which the pulse can be divided by three. In compound meter, pulse refers to the perceived beat.

**Complex meter** is any meter that is a combination of duple, triple, or quadruple meters.

**Pitch** is relative frequency of sound (lower vs. higher). When air is moved, sound is produced. Sound travels in waves and travels about one mile in 5 seconds. 
**Indefinite pitch** is made when air travels in random waves like thunder, random noise.
**Definite pitch** is made when air travels in uniform waves like singing. Music is made up mostly of definite pitch. 
Frequency refers to the rate at which the waves of air reach our ear. Frequency is measured in **cycles per second**. A cycle is from one **wave crest** to the next wave crest. The frequency of a sound wave determines the pitch. 
When the rate at which sound waves reach the ear is more frequent, the result is a higher sounding pitch. 
When the rate at which sound waves reach the ear is less frequent, the result is a lower sounding pitch. 

**Staff** is the device by which we indicate pitch. **Staff lines** are the 5 lines and 4 spaces to indicates pitch. **Ledger line** is an additional lines above and below the 5 lines. 

**Clef** is a symbol placed at the beginning of a staff, which indicates the exact pitches the staff lines and spaces will represent.
**treble clef** is for higher pitches, typically for the right hand. 
**bass clef** is for lower pitches, typically for the left hand.

Types of movement on the staff
- **Stepping**
  - From line to the next space above or below
  - From space to the next line above or below
- **Skipping**
  - From line to the next line above or below
  - From space to the next space above or below
- **Repeating**
  - Same pitch

**Grand staff** is to combine treble clef and bass clef by **brace**, for example for piano. It's the joining of the treble and bass staves. **Middle C** is located on the single ledger line between the treble and bass staves.

Distance on the keyboard
- **Half step** is the distance from one key to the **very next key** either to the right or left. **It does not matter if the key is black or white**.
  - C -> C flat
  - E -> F
- **Whole step** is the distance of **two half steps**.
  - C -> D
  - B -> C flat
